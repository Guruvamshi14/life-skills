# Learning Process: A Simple Guide

### What is the Feynman Technique?
It’s a way of learning where you explain a topic in very simple words. If you can’t explain it clearly, it means you need to understand it better.

### What idea from the video did I like the most?
- I liked the idea of **stepping away when stuck**. When we relax, our brain works in the background (diffused mode) and can find new ideas.  
- I also liked the point that **real mastery comes from practice**. Just understanding is not enough — we need to use the concept again and again in different ways.

### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
- **Active mode:** Focused thinking. You give full attention to a problem or task.  
- **Diffused mode:** Relaxed thinking. You step back, let your mind wander, and see new connections.

### Steps to learn a new topic (from the video)
1. Break the skill into smaller parts  
2. Learn just enough to fix mistakes  
3. Remove distractions or barriers  
4. Practice for at least 20 hours  

### What actions will I take to improve learning?
- **Feynman Technique:** Explain in simple words to check my understanding.  
- **Use Diffused Thinking:** Take breaks when stuck to get new ideas.  
- **Pomodoro Technique:** Work in short focused sessions to avoid procrastination.  
- **Practice for Mastery:** Keep practicing in different situations until I fully understand.
