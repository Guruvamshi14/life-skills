# Listening and Active Communication  

## 1. Active Listening – Steps/Strategies  
Here are six important steps to practice Active Listening:  

1. **Give Full Attention** – Focus completely on the speaker. Keep away distractions like phones or laptops. Maintain eye contact and show that you’re present.  
2. **Show Engagement** – Use body language like nodding, smiling, and saying short words like “Yes” or “I see” to show that you are listening.  
3. **Avoid Interruptions** – Let the speaker finish before you respond. Do not cut in or complete their sentences.  
4. **Reflect and Paraphrase** – Repeat back what you understood in your own words. This shows you were paying attention and helps avoid confusion.  
5. **Ask Open-Ended Questions** – Ask questions that invite the speaker to explain more, instead of just “yes” or “no” answers.  
6. **Respond Thoughtfully** – Take a short pause and give a meaningful reply that shows you really understood the message.

## 2. Fisher’s Model – Reflective Listening (in simple English)  
Reflective listening is about listening carefully and repeating back what the other person says so they know you really understand them.  

- **Mirror Feelings** – Show that you understand their emotions. For example: *“You seem worried about this project.”*  
- **Verify the Message** – Paraphrase what they said to check if you got it right. Example: *“So, you mean the meeting is moved to tomorrow?”*  
- **Notice Body Language and Tone** – Pay attention not just to words but also to how they sound and look when speaking.  
- **Clear Misunderstandings** – If something is not clear, ask questions or restate what you heard.  
- **Encourage Open Talk** – Make the speaker feel safe so they share more openly.  
- **Respond in the Right Way** – Give answers that show you understood their message and feelings.

## 3. Obstacles in My Listening  
- **Distractions** – Noise, phone, or multitasking breaks my focus.  
- **Prejudgments** – Assuming what the speaker will say before they finish.  
- **Emotional Barriers** – My own stress or mood makes it hard to listen.  
- **Lack of Interest** – If I find the topic boring, I lose attention.  
- **Not Understanding** – Complex words or technical terms confuse me.  
- **Rushing to Reply** – Thinking about my answer instead of fully listening.
